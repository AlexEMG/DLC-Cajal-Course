## Acknowledgments

Naturally this material is heavily based on [DeepLabCut's Jupyter book](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/README.html) as well as [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut) in general. The same license applies.


# SECTION FOR TAs (will be removed):

This section will be removed but for now will be used to share information with you!

## How to build the jupyter book? (this is only required before this repository is public)

Install: `pip install -U jupyter-book`

From the main folder, run the following command: `jupyter-book build .`

## To-dos -- mostly for AM but feel free to help :)

- use jupyter book bibliography for the references in the book, https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html
- there are a number of TBD items in the document, those are for AM to fix (or maybe you can contribute?)!
