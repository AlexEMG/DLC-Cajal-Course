# Using the DeepLabCut Model Zoo (30 min)

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/COLAB/COLAB_DEMO_SuperAnimal.ipynb) 🦁🦓🐘:
Imagine a digital toolbox, but instead of regular tools, it's filled with ready-to-use AI models designed especially for animal movement analysis. Born in 2020 and supercharged in 2022, this "Model Zoo" has:

- **1️⃣ Ready-Made Models:** Skip the training step and get straight to analyzing.
- **2️⃣ Contribute & Grow:** A community space where you can share data to make these models even smarter.
- **3️⃣ Easy Access:** Use directly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/COLAB/COLAB_DEMO_SuperAnimal.ipynb), your browser (DLC GUI), or even the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DeepLabCut/MegaDetector_DeepLabCut).
- **4️⃣ SuperAnimals!:** These are like the superheroes of AI models, combining various data to work on a range of animals, from dogs to mice, side views to top views.

No need to train anything; just pick a model, plug in your video, and watch it do its thing!

Get Started with Your Video! 🎥

Have a video of your cat's curious moments or your dog playing? Load it up! 🐈🐩 
Need a video? Check out <a href="https://www.pexels.com" target="_blank">Pexels</a> for some free options.

And if you're diving into research, remember we've got a top-view mouse model ready for you. 

1. Open the DeepLabCut GUI, look for the Model Zoo button and follow the on-screen steps: Pick your video, choose a model, and watch the magic happen🪄!
Once done, don't forget to peek into the folder where your video is saved to check your results.

2. You can also use this notebook to analyse your video:

```{note}
Notice how important it is to match the relative size of the individuals in the video. Why is that 🤔?
