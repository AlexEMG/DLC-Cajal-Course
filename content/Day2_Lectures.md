# Lectures: ML and DLC

If it is your first time working with Machine Learning then we highly recommend you start with Part 1 âœ¨.

However, if you are comfortable with the basics, just skip ahead to [the introduction of computer vision and DeepLabCut](#part-2:-Introduction-to-Computer-Vision-and-DeepLabCut)

## Part 1: Introduction to Machine Learning (50 min)

```{note}
Art Samuel stated that Machine Learning "is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
```
