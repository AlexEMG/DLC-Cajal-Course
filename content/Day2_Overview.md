# Overview Day 2

Welcome to day 2!

Today we will start with [two lectures](Day2_Lectures.md). The first lecture provides a general introduction to machine learning that serves as a basis for all coming days. The second part introduces Computer Vision and DeepLabCut, which is the major topic of today and tomorrow! 

In the [practical part](Day2_Practicals.md), we will build our first DeepLabCut models!
