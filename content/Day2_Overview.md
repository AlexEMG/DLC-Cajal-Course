# Overview Day 2

Welcome to day 2!

Today we will start with [two lectures](Day2_Lectures.md). The first lecture provides a general introduction to machine learning that serves as a basis for all coming days. The second part introduces Computer Vision and DeepLabCut, which is the major topic of today and tomorrow!

In the [practical part](Day2_Practicals.md), we will build our first DeepLabCut models!

## Day 2: Take home message

```{Tip}
- What is a machine learning system?
- What data is needed to train a good pose estimation model for your data?
```

## Day 2: What do you need for tomorrow?

```{important}
- Consider labeling more frames (from different videos).
- Consider training your model for longer (over night).
```
