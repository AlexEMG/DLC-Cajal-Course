# Glossary

ðŸ”¡ All terms are alphabetically organized. 

**Annotation**: placement of the specific label(bodypart) on an image
   
**Batch size**: number of images processed in one iteration of training (max value constrained by GPU memory). More precise term is mini-batch

**Bodypart**: also called label, in DeepLabCut is a arbitrarily chosen part of the animal that the user wants to track

**[Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/)**: a visual reactive programming language that can be used to generate complex experimental workflows. Its [Bonsai.Deeplabcut package](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/deeplabcut) uses DeepLabCut-live for real-time markerless pose estimation. 

**[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**: Google Colab is a web based notebook used for writing and executing python code

**Cropping**: cutting out part of the image, used for reducing computational expense

**Dataset**: collection of annotations linked to specific images

**Detection**: placement of the label by the model

**Ground truth**: coordinates of the label in the immage annotated by the user

**Identity**: in multianimal DLC a parameter used for specyfing that annotations are subject specific (user can tell the difference between individuals)

**IID**: Independent and Identically Distributed, term used for variables that have same probability distribution but are independent from each other (a coin toss always has a 50% chance to be heads or tails, no matter what the previous result of a coin toss was)

**Inference**: applying a trained model on data i.e. analysis

**Iteration**: one pass of the batch through the network

**Jitter**: natural tendency of inferred data to slightly move between frames of analyzed video. Stems from inference happening on image by image basis

**[MoSeq](https://dattalab.github.io/moseq2-website/index.html)**: developed in [Datta's Lab](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/), an unsupervised machine learning method used to parse mouse behavior

**OOD**: Out-of-Domain, a term used to define data that was not used in training the model (a different dataset)

**Outlier**: a frame in which model made bad detections

**Project**: the folder structure and all its contents made during project creation and later work

**Refinement**: step of the workflow used for correction of bad detections on a subset of outlier frames

**RMSE**: root-mean-square error, measure of difference between values predicted by the model and ground truth

**[SimBA](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba)**: developed in [Golden's Lab](https://goldenneurolab.com/simba), a framework for training a supervised behavior annotation model

**Snapshot**: current state of the model with specific weights learned during training

**Supervised**: a model trained using labeled data with the goal of predicting the labels on unseen data. 

**Training**: process in which the model is learning to find weights that will allow it to solve assigned task (tracking bodyparts)

**Tracklet**: a fragment of a trajectory, relevant in multi-animal tracking. Tracklets are represented as nodes of a graph, whose edges encode the likelihood that a connected pair of tracklets belongs to the same trajectory

**Unsupervised**: a model trained without using human annotation, only patterns from the data

**[VAME](https://github.com/LINCellularNeuroscience/VAME)**: developed by Kevin Luxem and Pavol Bauer, a framework for unsupervised behavior clustering

**Weights**: parameters of a neural network used to process the input (images for DLC)
