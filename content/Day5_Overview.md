# What next?

We reached the final day of this course! Today there are no additional lectures, and no additional materials.

The major goal is to look back and reflect on what you learned. Do you have some remaining questions? Today is a great way to have those conversations.

Another major goal is to use the time and dive deeper into your analysis!

## Day 5: Take home messages

```{Tip}
- What is a machine learning system?
- What is the best approach for answering my biological question? (supervised/unsupervised/hybrid)
```

TODO_TA: What else?

## Day 5: Major goal for today
