# Overview Day 1

Welcome to Day 1✨!

We will kick start 🚀 the week with [two exciting lectures](Day1_Lectures.md):
- The neuronal cell types and circuits underlying locomotion, taught by Prof. Ole Kiehn from the University of Copenhagen and Karolinska ([this years Brain Prize winner](https://lundbeckfonden.com/en/the-brain-prize)😎)
- Studying natural behavior in corvids to elucidate cognition, taught by
Prof. Nicky Clayton from the University of Cambridge  

Click [HERE](Day1_Lectures.md) to watch the lectures! Please do so at your own pace before the practical session.

Later, in the [practical part](Day1_Practicals.md), we will discuss what is behavior and how can we understand it 🤔!

## Day 1: Take home messages

```{Tip}
- Defining behavior in a way that generates testable hypotheses is a non-trivial challenge. 
- Designing behavior experiments in a way that take feedback loops, homeostasis, and plasticity into account can also be a non-trivial challenge. 
- Taking time to "learn how to look" is an invaluable investment for anyone studying behavior.

## Day 1: Major Goals ⚽️

```{important}
1) Please ensure your DeepLabCut installation is ready! If you have a GPU, please make sure that it is utilized. You can ask the teaching assistants 📢, if you are not sure.
2) Please remember to bring your videos if you wish to work on your own data. Ideally select different videos that reflect the variability of the data in your setup and that you would like to analyze.
3) Please ensure that you have completed the Discord on-boarding process, and have chosen your tags in the "student-tags-2022" channel. 
4) *Read* the paper "You Say You Had a Revolution: Methodological Foundations of Closed-Loop Psychology", linked below. 
5) *Skim* the DLC Primer {cite}`Mathis2020`, linked below.
