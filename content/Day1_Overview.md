Welcome to Day 1✨!

We will kick start 🚀 the week with [two exciting lectures](Day1_Lectures.md):
- The neuronal cell types and circuits underlying locomotion, taught by Prof. Ole Kiehn from the University of Copenhagen and Karolinska ([this years Brain Prize winner](https://lundbeckfonden.com/en/the-brain-prize)😎)
- Studying natural behavior in corvids to elucidate cognition, taught by
Prof. Nicky Clayton from the University of Cambridge  

Click [HERE](Day1_Lectures.md) to watch the lectures! Please do so at your own pace before the practical session.

Later, in the [practical part](Day1_Practicals.md), we will discuss what is behavior and how can we understand it 🤔!

## Day 1: Major Goals ⚽️

```{important}
1) Please ensure your DeepLabCut installation is ready! If you have a GPU, please make sure that it is utilized. You can ask the teaching assistants 📢, if you are not sure.
2) Please remember to bring your videos if you wish to work on your own data. Ideally select different videos that reflect the variability of the data in your setup and that you would like to analyze.
3) *Skim* the following Primer {cite}`MATHIS2020`
