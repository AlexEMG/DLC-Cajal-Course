# Overview Day 1

Welcome to day 1 of this course!

Today we will start with [two exciting lectures](Day1_Lectures.md):
- Prof. Ole Kiehn from the University of Copenhagen and Karolinska, [this years Brain Prize winner](https://lundbeckfonden.com/en/the-brain-prize), talks about the neuronal cell types and circuits underlying locomotion
- Prof. Nicky Clayton from the University of Cambridge talks about about studying natural behavior in corvids to elucidate cognition

Click on this link to learn more and watch the [lectures](Day1_Lectures.md)! Please do so at your own pace before the practical session.

In the [practical part](Day1_Practicals.md), we will discuss what is behavior and how can we understand it!

## Day 1: What do you need for tomorrow?

```{important}
1) Please make sure your DeepLabCut installation is ready. In particular, if you have a GPU, please make sure that it is utilized. Please ask the teaching assistants, if you are not sure.
2) Please remember to bring your videos if you wish to work on your own data. Ideally select a few different videos that reflect the variability of the data in your setup and that you would like to analyze.
3) *Skim* the following publication: Mathis, Schneider, Lauer, Mathis [A Primer on Motion Capture with Deep Learning: Principles, Pitfalls, and Perspectives](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320307170), Neuron 2020
