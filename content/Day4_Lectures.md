Key papers mentioned in this talk:
- [Using a biologically mimicking climbing robot to explore the performance landscape of climbing in lizards](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.2576) by Schultz JT, Beck HK, Haagensen T, Proost T, Clemente CJ. in Proc Biol Sci. 2021
- [Tail Base Deflection but not Tail Curvature Varies with Speed in Lizards: Results from an Automated Tracking Analysis Pipeline

Further reading (goes beyond this course, but recommended):
- [Biomechanics of Movement: The Science of Sports, Robotics, and Rehabilitation](https://biomech.stanford.edu/) by Thomas K. Uchida and Scott L. Delp

TODO_TA: What other material shall we recommend?

## Part 2: Behavioral analysis with MoSeq (30 min)

Content:
- Unsupervised analysis of behavior
- Moseq pipeline (depth cameras, AR-HMM, ...)
- Keypoint-Moseq
- Results and biological

TODO_TA: Any other recommendations for content of this or prior class?
TODO_AM: record lecture.

Further reading (recommended in the scope of this course):
