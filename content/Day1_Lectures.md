The Kiehn lab has actively been using DeepLabCut for many years. Check out our [blog post](https://deeplabcut.medium.com/deeplabcut-meets-the-brainstem-how-deep-learning-for-behavior-yields-insights-into-the-neural-3d6dd24838ed) discussing their use of DeepLabCut for studying brain stem. You will also find an interview with Dr. Jared Cregg, who spearheaded their beautiful 2020 Nature Neuroscience study {cite}`Cregg2020`.

## Lecture 2: Comparative cognition with magic tricks (⏳ 45 min)

[Prof. Nicky Clayton](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?nsclayton) from the University of Cambridge talks about about studying natural behavior in corvids to elucidate cognition.
