## Lecture: The circuits underlying locomotion (45 min)

[Prof. Ole Kiehn from the University of Copenhagen and Karolinska Institute](https://in.ku.dk/research/kiehn-lab/), [this years Brain Prize winner](https://lundbeckfonden.com/en/the-brain-prize), talks about the neuronal cell types and circuits underlying locomotion

Prof. Kiehn's lab has actively been using DeepLabCut for many years. We recently wrote a [blog post](https://deeplabcut.medium.com/deeplabcut-meets-the-brainstem-how-deep-learning-for-behavior-yields-insights-into-the-neural-3d6dd24838ed) discussing their use of DeepLabCut for studying brain stem in more detail. The post also contains an interview with Dr. Jared Cregg, who spearheaded their beautiful 2020 Nature Neuroscience study, which is also discussed in the lecture.

## Lecture: Cognition in corvids (TBD update title / 45 min)

[Prof. Nicky Clayton from the University of Cambridge](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?nsclayton) talks about about studying natural behavior in corvids to elucidate cognition
