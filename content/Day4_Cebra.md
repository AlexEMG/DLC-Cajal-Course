# Joint behavioral-neural data analysis

One way to perform joint behavioral-neural analysis based on behavioral measurements, is using <a href="https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/cebra" target="_blank">Cebra.ai</a>. 

# CEBRA: Consistent EmBeddings of High-Dimensional Recordings

**CEBRA** is a Python library designed for the estimation of consistent embeddings for high-dimensional recordings using behaviour as an auxiliary variable. Implemented in PyTorch, CEBRA is tailored to cater to datasets commonly found in biology and neuroscience. 

To dig into Cebra we recommend working on one particular notebook. For the demo, we will focus on using CEBRA on rat hippocampus data derived from [Grosman and Buzsaki](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad1935). Here is the link to the [notebook](https://cebra.ai/docs/demo_notebooks/Demo_hippocampus.html), where you can find all required steps! Happy hacking!
