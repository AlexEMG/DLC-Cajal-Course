# Joint behavioral-neural data analysis

## Cebra

One way to perform joint behavioral-neural analysis based on behavioral measurements, is using <a href="https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/cebra" target="_blank">Cebra.ai</a>. Classical methods include GLMs, and many other techniques (see below). Please check the documentation for details on [Cebra](https://cebra.ai/docs/usage.html). 

%TODO: UPDATE LINK!

For more details and options, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/DLC2Kinematics/blob/master/DEMO.ipynb" target="_blank">Cebra demo notebook on hippocampus</a>.

Highly recommended reading ðŸ“š (recommended in the scope of this course):
I'd like some GLM neuro ref here ...
