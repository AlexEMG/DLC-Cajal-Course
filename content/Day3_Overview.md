# Advanced DeepLabCut topics

Welcome to day 3!

Today we will start with [a few videos on DeepLabCut](Day3_Lectures.md) spanning topics from DLC-live, via multi-animal pose estimation to the model zoo.

In the [practical part](Day3_Practicals.md), we will keep improving our DeepLabCut models from yesterday, as well as working on other topics discussed in the class.
