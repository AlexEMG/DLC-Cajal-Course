# Course Overview

The goal of neuroscience is to understand how the nervous system controls behaviour, not only in the simplified environments of the lab, but also in the natural environments for which nervous systems evolved.

In pursuing this goal, neuroscience research is supported by an ever-larger toolbox, ranging from optogenetics to connectomics. However, often these tools are coupled with reductionist approaches for linking nervous systems and behaviour. This course will introduce advanced techniques for measuring and analysing behaviour, as well as three fundamental principles as necessary to understanding biological behaviour: (1) morphology and environment; (2) action-perception closed loops and purpose; and (3) individuality and historical contingencies [1].

## What will you learn?

This course will emphasize the philosophical and observational skills required to understand behaviour, while also providing training in motion capture technologies and computer vision methods that can assist in the collection and analysis of video recorded behaviour datasets.

Focusing on the tool DeepLabCut, students will analyse either their own original video dataset or datasets of general interest and have the opportunity to practice tracking, pose estimation, action segmentation, kinematic analysis and modeling of behaviour.

By the end of the course, you will:

- be familiar with modern and historical frameworks for studying the behaviour of living biological systems
- practice methods for carefully and precisely observing and defining behaviours
- understand the limits and capabilities of computer vision
- develop an intuition for how to build experimental setups that can take a-  dvantage of tools such as DeepLabCut

Furthermore, this course shares and promotes open-source software, and we encourage students to try new ideas, share insights, and connect with the open-source community.

## Structure of the course

Each day, from Monday to Thursday, will start of with lectures presenting related work. As the course happens in different time zones, you can watch those pre-recorded lectures at your own time. We will release them day-by-day.

Each day (Monday - Friday) also comprises 4h of practical work with teaching assistants during which you will go over course materials spanning conceptual (Day 1), to practical content (Day 2 - 4). We have an excellent teaching assistant to student ratio of around 5:1! You will either interact with your teaching assistants locally in different satellites (Buenos Aires, Nairobi, London, Warsaw, Munich, Colorado Springs, and Okinawa) or online.

Over the course of the week you can either work on your own data to create a DeepLabCut model and then analyze kinematics, cluster behaviors or perform actions segmentation (Day 4 and 5). If you do not have suitable data, we will provide example datasets to work on (TBD).

Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions!
