# Lectures

First, let's assume you have a model that is great for analyzing your data. In that case, you can 1Ô∏è‚É£ extend it to a multianimal project if applicable (**maDeepLabCut**), 2Ô∏è‚É£ share it with the community (**Model Zoo**), 3Ô∏è‚É£ use it in closed-loop behavior experiments (**DeepLabCut-live**), or 4Ô∏è‚É£ integrate it with other camera views for 3D pose estimation (**3D DeepLabCut**).

## Part 1: maDeepLabCut (‚è≥30 min)

- (Additional) challenges for multi-individual pose estimation (vs. single animal)
- Bottom-up vs. Top-down methods üîºüîΩ
- Check this paper {cite}`Lauer2022` and how maDLC works
- supervised and unsupervised identification of indivudals
- Tracking
- Metrics üìê for multi-individual pose est. mAP, MOTA, etc.

TODO_AM: record lecture.

## Part 1: DeepLabCut-live (‚è≥15 min)

DeepLabCut provides additional software packages that allow you to record and stream camera data and run DeeplabCut models in real-time. You can get a quick overview by watching this short [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDSgddOqHtM).

For more details, please watch üëÄ Gary Kane's [DLC-live Neuromatch talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwOTdxpU2_4). This recording also contains questions from the audience, so you can stop after minute 7.

For more information on this work, please check out {cite}`Kane2020` 


- put more stuff üì¶ on benchmarking
- update to Goal ‚öΩÔ∏è for the end of the day


TODO_TA: Any other recommendations for content for this module?
