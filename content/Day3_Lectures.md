# Lectures

Today we have lectures on several topics -->  1️⃣ how to track multiple animals witht DeepLabCut (**maDeepLabCut**), 2️⃣ how to share models with the community and how we create SuperModels (**Model Zoo**), 3️⃣ use DeepLabCut in closed-loop behavior experiments (**DeepLabCut-live**), or 4️⃣ integrate it with other camera views for 3D pose estimation (**3D DeepLabCut**).

## Part 1: maDeepLabCut (⏳30 min)

- (Additional) challenges for multi-individual pose estimation (vs. single animal)
- Bottom-up vs. Top-down methods 🔼🔽
- Check this paper {cite}`Lauer2022` and how maDLC works
- supervised and unsupervised identification of indivudals
- Tracking
- Metrics 📐 for multi-individual pose est. mAP, MOTA, etc.

TODO_AM: record lecture.

As a stand-in for now, please check out minutes 30-42

## Part 1: DeepLabCut-live (⏳15 min)

DeepLabCut provides additional software packages that allow you to record and stream camera data and run DeeplabCut models in real-time. You can get a quick overview by watching this short [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDSgddOqHtM).

For more details, please watch 👀 Gary Kane's [DLC-live Neuromatch talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwOTdxpU2_4). This recording also contains questions from the audience, so you can stop after minute 7.

For more information on this work, please check out {cite}`Kane2020` 


- put more stuff 📦 on benchmarking
- update to Goal ⚽️ for the end of the day

DLC-live also provides a convenient API for combining animal pose estimation with other tasks. For example, DLC-live was used here in combination with MegaDetector to estimate the pose of animals detected in camera trap data. You can see a demo [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DeepLabCut/MegaDetector_DeepLabCut) and inspect the code further [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DeepLabCut/MegaDetector_DeepLabCut/tree/main).

TODO_TA: Any other recommendations for content for this module?
