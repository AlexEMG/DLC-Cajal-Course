# Lectures

Today we have lectures on several topics -->  1Ô∏è‚É£ how to track multiple animals with DeepLabCut (**maDeepLabCut**), 2Ô∏è‚É£ how to share models with the community and how we create SuperModels (**Model Zoo**), 3Ô∏è‚É£ how to use DeepLabCut in closed-loop behavior experiments (**DeepLabCut-live**), as well as 4Ô∏è‚É£ how to integrate it with other camera views for 3D pose estimation (**3D DeepLabCut**).

## Part 3: DeepLabCut-live (‚è≥15 min)

DeepLabCut provides additional software packages that allow you to record and stream camera data and run DeeplabCut models in real-time. You can get a quick overview by watching this short [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDSgddOqHtM).

For more details, please watch üëÄ Gary Kane's [DLC-live Neuromatch talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwOTdxpU2_4). This recording also contains questions from the audience, so you can stop after minute 7.

For more information on this work, please check out {cite}`Kane2020`. Regarding inference speeds, please also check out the [DLC Inference Speed Benchmark](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DLC-inferencespeed-benchmark/). You can also contribute inference speeds for additional hardware [here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DLC-inferencespeed-benchmark), plus check out {cite}`Kane2020` for more details.

DLC-live also provides a convenient API for combining animal pose estimation with other tasks. For example, DLC-live was used here in combination with MegaDetector to estimate the pose of animals detected in camera trap data. You can see a demo which also uses the Model Zoo [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DeepLabCut/MegaDetector_DeepLabCut) and inspect the code further [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DeepLabCut/MegaDetector_DeepLabCut/tree/main).


## Part 4: 3D DeepLabCut (‚è≥15 min)
