# Lectures

First, let's assume you have a model from yesterday that is great for analyzing your data. In that case you can also use it in behavior experiments! This is what DeepLabCut-live allows.

## Part 1: DeepLabCut-live (15 min)

DeepLabCut provides additional software packages that allow you to record and stream camera data and run DeeplabCut models in real-time. You can get a quick overview by watching this short [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDSgddOqHtM).

For more details, please watch Gary Kane's [DLC-live Neuromatch talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwOTdxpU2_4). This recording also contains questions from the audience, so you stop after minute 7.
