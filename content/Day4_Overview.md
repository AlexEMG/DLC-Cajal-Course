# Overview Day 4

Welcome to day 4!

Today we will start with [lectures](Day4_Lectures.md) covering diverse topics such as:
- kinematic and biomechanics
- clustering behaviors
- action segmentation

TODO: put links to lecture sections

In the [practical part](Day4_Practicals.md), we will keep dig into those topics based on the data that you have been working on. For the sake of time, try to focus only on one application and work on it. We will try to optimally match up students and teaching assistants to make this process as smooth as possible. Please notice, that tomorrow you will also have time to keep working on your project (there will be no new content).

At the end of Friday there will also be the possibility to present your project, if you are interested! Please get in touch with Danbee, if you want to do so!
