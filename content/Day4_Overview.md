# Overview Day 4

Welcome to day 4✨!

Today is the last day of [lectures](Day4_Lectures.md) and we chose to cover diverse, exciting topics 🔥 such as 
- kinematics,
- comparative biomechanics,
- measuring behavior from other modalities,
- joint neural-behavioral analysis,
- behavioral analysis (with clustering/unsupervised)
- and action segmentation (supervised)

Later, in the [practical part](Day4_Practicals.md), we will keep digging into these subjects based on the data that you have been working on. Overall, the lectures are almost 3h long! So, also here you can pick your favorites, and watch other talks tomorrow.

For the sake of time, try to focus 🔍 on only one application and work on it. We will try to optimally match up students and TAs to make this process as smooth as possible.

Please note that tomorrow, you will also have time ⏳ to continue your project.

At the end of Friday you could present your project and receive feedback💪! Please get in touch 📲 with Danbee, if you want to do so!

## Day 4: Take home messages

```{Tip}
- What is the difference between unsupervised and supervised behavioral analysis?
- What are their strengths and weaknesses?
```

## Day 4: Major goals ⚽️

```{important}
- Find the most suitable approach for addressing your biological question and dive 🐬 into tackling it!
